This PHP class will help you to work with your Pinterest account. You don't
need to register application in Pintererst to get access token for api. Use
only your account login and password.

Some functions use pinterest navigation through results, for example,
get user followers. Function returns generator object with api results as batches in 
every iteration. By default functions return all pinterest result batches, but you can 
pass batches num as second argument. For example, 
```php 
$bot->pins->search('query', 2)
```
will return only 2 batches of search results.
